# Morse Code Translator
**Made by Khadijat Oyeleye**

This is a Javascript-based morse code translator made with HTML 5, SCSS, Javascript ES6 and unit tested with Jest.

This project was created in week 5 of the _nology course. The aim was to gain experience with test-driven development - writing unit tests then writing functions which passed those tests. 

### Test Description
Two main test conditions were created, denoted by the describe blocks - one for testing whether the function written converted single english letters into morse code, and the other for testing whether the function written converted english words into morse code. Example checks were given for each condition - a few random letters for the first test condition and a couple of words for the second.

### Tested Function
The function that was tested initially split the english word entered by the user into an array of letters. These were then converted into morse code, creating a new array of individual morse letters. These were then joined together to create the morse word. This function satisifed the test conditions.

### DOM Description
This converted the english input that was given into a morse output and displayed it on the page for the user after the submit button was pressed.

### Known Bugs
There are no known bugs as of 23/11/21.

### Summary
Overall, I am happy that I managed to create and design a working translator in the very limited time that was given to us, especially in comparison to previous projects. In the future, I would like to enable users to receive translations of sentences, including punctuation.
